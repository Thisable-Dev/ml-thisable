# Currency Detection

[Currency Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/najmaaaaaaaaa/currencyhp)

Using 9,100 primary images [data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/najmaaaaaaaaa/currencyhp) of Indonesian currency with 7 labels, we do transfer learning using the MobileNet V2 model and got a validation accuracy of **91%**. We use the MobileNet V2 model because it is a light weight model, has high accuracy, and trains quickly.
We adjust the network model and the input size so that it fits with the data we have.
